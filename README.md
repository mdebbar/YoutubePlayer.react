YoutubePlayer.react
===================

React component for rendering and controlling an embedded Youtube player.

The component is written in JavaScript Harmony (ES6), so you need to use the harmony flag with jsx (read about it [here](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/07/17/react-v0.11.html#jsx)). It's using the Youtube's Iframe Player API which renders the player in an iframe.


### Missing features/future work:
- Provide some examples
- Support playlists
- Allow access to video information e.g. title, duration, url, 
- Report buffering progress through callbacks
- Support other options e.g. start-end ranges, playback quality, etc
- Support more APIs e.g. get/set volume, set size, get current time, etc
